# Setup for contributors

These instructions will prepare your environment for developing Relevance Studio.

Tested on MacOS 15.5.

---

### Step 1. Prepare your environment

Install dependencies:

1. Install [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm?tab=readme-ov-file#installing-and-updating) *(required by [UI](docs/{{VERSION}}/reference/architecture.md#ui))*
2. Install [python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (tested on version 3.10) *(required by [Server](docs/{{VERSION}}/reference/architecture.md#server), [Worker](docs/{{VERSION}}/reference/architecture.md#worker), [MCP Server](docs/{{VERSION}}/reference/architecture.md#mcp-server), [MCP Proxy](docs/{{VERSION}}/reference/architecture.md#mcp-proxy))*
3. Install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) (tested on version 27.3.1) *(required for integration tests)*

Clone this repo:

1. Run `git clone https://github.com/elastic/relevance-studio.git`
2. Run `cd relevance-studio` to enter the root-level directory of this project
3. Copy `.env-reference` to `.env`
4. Configure `.env` to use the endpoints and credentials of your Elastic deployment

---

### Step 2. Run the Server in development mode

In a terminal, navigate to the root-level directory of this project and run:

1. Run `python3 -m venv .venv` to create a virtual environment
2. Run `source .venv/bin/activate` to activate the virtual environment
3. Run `pip install --upgrade pip` to ensure pip is up to date
4. Run `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt` to install the dependencies
5. Run `python -m src.server.flask` to run the server in development mode

Repeat steps 2 and 5 anytime you need to start the server in a new terminal.

---

### Step 3. Run the UI in development mode

In a terminal, navigate to the root-level directory of this project and run:

1. Run `nvm install && nvm use` to use the node version specified in `.nvmrc`
2. Run `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` in the root project directory to install dependencies listed in `package.json`
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the app using the script defined in `package.json`
4. Open [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) in your browser to open the app in development mode

Repeat steps 1, 3, and 4 anytime you need to start the UI in a new terminal.

---

### Step 4. Run an evaluation worker process

In a terminal, navigate to the root-level directory of this project and run:

1. Run `source .venv/bin/activate` to activate the virtual environment
2. Run `python -m src.server.worker` to run a worker process

Repeat these steps anytime you need to start a worker in another terminal.

---

### Step 5. Setup the index templates and indices

With the server and UI running from Steps 2 and 3, open [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) and click the button on the homepage to setup the index templates and indices.

---

### Step 6. (Optional) Run the MCP Server

In a terminal, navigate to the root-level directory of this project and run:

1. Run `source .venv/bin/activate` to activate the virtual environment
2. Run `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt` to install dependencies *(skip if done in Step 2)*
3. Run `python -m src.server.fastmcp` to start the MCP Server

Repeat steps 1 and 3 anytime you need to start the MCP Server in another terminal.

---

### Step 7. (Optional) Run the MCP Proxy for local MCP hosts

The MCP Proxy bridges Claude Desktop (stdio) to the running MCP Server (HTTP).
The MCP Server must be running (Step 5) before Claude Desktop can connect.

From the project root, run:

```bash
python scripts/integrate_claude_desktop.py
```

This reads `.env` and writes the correct entry into Claude Desktop's config
automatically. Then restart Claude Desktop completely (Cmd+Q, then reopen).

**Re-run this command and restart Claude Desktop whenever `.env` changes**
(e.g. when you toggle TLS or AUTH).

### Testing

- Run `pytest tests/unit` to run unit tests for the Server.
- Run `pytest tests/integration` to run integration tests. Requires Docker. The test suite starts and stops its own Elasticsearch and Server containers automatically using `tests/docker-compose.yml`.
