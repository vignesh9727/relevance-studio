# Release notes

## v1.2.2

### Improvements

- Hardened TLS/auth defaults: fail fast on bad TLS in stdio proxy, auto-generate `AUTH_JWT_SECRET` in non-interactive installs, and documented plaintext credential storage. ([113e6cf](https://github.com/elastic/relevance-studio/commit/113e6cf))
- Added stdio MCP proxy with Claude Desktop integration script and TLS-aware upstream forwarding. ([b77f659](https://github.com/elastic/relevance-studio/commit/b77f659))

### Bug fixes

- Fixed bug when fresh install prompts for upgrade instead of setup. ([94ef73f](https://github.com/elastic/relevance-studio/commit/94ef73f))
- Fixed an issue where TLS and AUTH configuration prompts were shown for versions before v1.2.0. ([a06611f](https://github.com/elastic/relevance-studio/commit/a06611f))
- Fixed login redirect loop when `AUTH_ENABLED=false`. ([dbf10ae](https://github.com/elastic/relevance-studio/commit/dbf10ae))

## v1.2.1

### Bug fixes

- Fixed quickstart self-signed TLS certificate generation to include the internal Docker MCP hostname (`esrs-server-mcp`) in `subjectAltName`, resolving TLS hostname mismatch errors during Server → MCP startup in local installs. ([26304c0](https://github.com/elastic/relevance-studio/commit/26304c0))

## v1.2.0

### Features

- Added per-user authentication with JWT sessions and pass-through Elasticsearch credentials for the studio deployment. Users log in with their own ES credentials; username/password login creates a session API key, while API-key login reuses the provided API key. Controlled by `AUTH_ENABLED` (default: `true`). ([Issue 4](https://github.com/elastic/relevance-studio/issues/4)) ([2a9b84a](https://github.com/elastic/relevance-studio/commit/2a9b84a), [7866176](https://github.com/elastic/relevance-studio/commit/7866176))
- Added authentication for the MCP Server via `Authorization` header (Basic, ApiKey, Bearer schemes). ([Issue 5](https://github.com/elastic/relevance-studio/issues/5)) ([fb62d8e](https://github.com/elastic/relevance-studio/commit/fb62d8e))
- Added native TLS support for the Server and MCP Server. Controlled by `TLS_ENABLED` (default: `true`). ([Issue 3](https://github.com/elastic/relevance-studio/issues/3)) ([4d6afd4](https://github.com/elastic/relevance-studio/commit/4d6afd4))
- Added `@meta.created_via` channel-tracking to asset documents (`"server"`, `"mcp"`, `"api"`), and `@meta.updated_via` where assets support update semantics. ([Issue 2](https://github.com/elastic/relevance-studio/issues/2)) ([1e773f8](https://github.com/elastic/relevance-studio/commit/1e773f8))
- Added login screen to the UI with username/password and API key authentication modes. ([Issue 6](https://github.com/elastic/relevance-studio/issues/6)) ([fcec321](https://github.com/elastic/relevance-studio/commit/fcec321), [220d26e](https://github.com/elastic/relevance-studio/commit/220d26e))

### Improvements

- Refactored Elasticsearch client to support per-request clients alongside singleton service-account clients, enabling authenticated operations per user. ([Issue 1](https://github.com/elastic/relevance-studio/issues/1)) ([7866176](https://github.com/elastic/relevance-studio/commit/7866176))
- The judgements `rated-human` / `rated-ai` filter now uses `@meta.updated_via` (channel), while retaining `@meta.updated_by` checks for compatibility with existing data. ([635198f](https://github.com/elastic/relevance-studio/commit/635198f))
- Added index template migration `1.2.0` to add `created_via` and `updated_via` fields to existing indices. ([Issue 7](https://github.com/elastic/relevance-studio/issues/7)) ([ad3919e](https://github.com/elastic/relevance-studio/commit/ad3919e))
- Quickstart script now supports interactive TLS certificate generation and authentication setup. ([468957f](https://github.com/elastic/relevance-studio/commit/468957f), [cdd0159](https://github.com/elastic/relevance-studio/commit/cdd0159))

### Breaking changes

- `AUTH_ENABLED` now exists and defaults to `true`. When enabled, API routes require login and `AUTH_JWT_SECRET` must be configured. ([468957f](https://github.com/elastic/relevance-studio/commit/468957f))
- `TLS_ENABLED` now exists and defaults to `true`. When enabled, `TLS_CERT_FILE` and `TLS_KEY_FILE` are required at startup. ([468957f](https://github.com/elastic/relevance-studio/commit/468957f))

### Bug fixes

- Fixed a race condition in the UI login flow and improved redirect behavior after authentication. ([e8ea664](https://github.com/elastic/relevance-studio/commit/e8ea664), [f267a41](https://github.com/elastic/relevance-studio/commit/f267a41), [ef185ba](https://github.com/elastic/relevance-studio/commit/ef185ba))
- Fixed MCP Server connection behavior when TLS is enabled. ([8065cfa](https://github.com/elastic/relevance-studio/commit/8065cfa))
- Fixed chat panel regressions and related UI bugs. ([b8a49bb](https://github.com/elastic/relevance-studio/commit/b8a49bb))

## v1.1.1

### Features

- Added evaluation throttling controls to limit and pace `_rank_eval` requests, with global environment defaults and per-benchmark overrides via `task.rank_eval_batch_size` and `task.rank_eval_batch_delay`. Also added `task.requests` to track request volume. ([Data model](docs/{{VERSION}}/reference/data-model.md#benchmarks)) ([3b376e9](https://github.com/elastic/relevance-studio/commit/3b376e9), [90bd96e](https://github.com/elastic/relevance-studio/commit/90bd96e), [5ee45ea](https://github.com/elastic/relevance-studio/commit/5ee45ea), [61be00a](https://github.com/elastic/relevance-studio/commit/61be00a))

### Improvements

- Expanded security guidance for the studio deployment role by documenting required cluster privileges (`manage_index_templates`, `monitor`) in addition to `monitor_inference`. ([Security](docs/{{VERSION}}/reference/security.md#studio-deployment-role-configuration)) ([657d3ff](https://github.com/elastic/relevance-studio/commit/657d3ff))
- Updated documentation screenshots and benchmark/reference docs to reflect the v1.1 UI and data model updates. ([Welcome](docs/{{VERSION}}/guide/welcome.md), [Data model](docs/{{VERSION}}/reference/data-model.md#benchmarks)) ([983963c](https://github.com/elastic/relevance-studio/commit/983963c), [0fadb4b](https://github.com/elastic/relevance-studio/commit/0fadb4b))

### Bug fixes

- Fixed quickstart command usage in docs to use explicit `--version` flags and corrected minor docs/linking issues. ([Quickstart](docs/{{VERSION}}/guide/quickstart.md)) ([80ab4f7](https://github.com/elastic/relevance-studio/commit/80ab4f7), [c3a695a](https://github.com/elastic/relevance-studio/commit/c3a695a))

## v1.1.0

### Features

- Added a new [Agent API](docs/{{VERSION}}/reference/rest-api.md#agent-api) for streaming chat responses, endpoint discovery, and cancellation, plus a chat experience in the UI with persisted [Conversations](docs/{{VERSION}}/reference/data-model.md#conversations). ([bffcdbc](https://github.com/elastic/relevance-studio/commit/bffcdbc), [7557c52](https://github.com/elastic/relevance-studio/commit/7557c52))
- Added additive upgrade support with a dedicated [`POST /api/upgrade`](docs/{{VERSION}}/reference/rest-api.md#upgrade-api) endpoint and richer [Setup API checks](docs/{{VERSION}}/reference/rest-api.md#setup-api) that report upgrade state. ([4300643](https://github.com/elastic/relevance-studio/commit/4300643))
- Extended the [Workspaces data model](docs/{{VERSION}}/reference/data-model.md#workspaces) with `description` and surfaced it in the UI for better project context. ([298daf1](https://github.com/elastic/relevance-studio/commit/298daf1))

### Improvements

- Persisted and restored scenarios in URL state for the Judgements page and Strategy editor to improve navigation/shareability. ([e59488a](https://github.com/elastic/relevance-studio/commit/e59488a))
- Added UI context sharing from the app into chat requests so the agent can use current resource context more effectively and with fewer MCP tool calls. ([174eba9](https://github.com/elastic/relevance-studio/commit/174eba9))
- Improved chat context handling by including resource context in `ui_context`, reducing unnecessary MCP tool calls. ([174eba9](https://github.com/elastic/relevance-studio/commit/174eba9))
- Improved system prompt quality and navigation ergonomics across the updated chat/user flows. ([e9eacdd](https://github.com/elastic/relevance-studio/commit/e9eacdd))

### Bug fixes

- Improved handling for missing inference endpoints, reachability checks, and license requirements in home/chat workflows. ([32431ed](https://github.com/elastic/relevance-studio/commit/32431ed), [d01740d](https://github.com/elastic/relevance-studio/commit/d01740d), [cefeafe](https://github.com/elastic/relevance-studio/commit/cefeafe), [3793d5c](https://github.com/elastic/relevance-studio/commit/3793d5c))

### Removed
